# A Mini Photoshop, or Something

This took a month and a half of work to make, while only working on it for 5 days a week, and two and a half hours per day. I could list all of the functions, but there are *so.. many...*<br>
<br>
A few examples include:
- **shrink**: *Shrinks an image by a scalar*
- **tile**: *Tiles an image x, y times*
- **brightness**: *Adjust the brightness of the image*
- **rotate**: *Rotates an image by 90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees, with an option to rotate in tiles* (probably the most functional and complex function)
- and more
<br>
There are 3 <em>parts</em> I have preset at the bottom of the file. They each show off functions, and how powerful this can be.
I still have plans on working on this in the future, but I am working on schoolwork right now. There are farily detailed docstrings, so hopefully they help.
